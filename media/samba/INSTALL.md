## ⚡️ Automatic installation
   ### For a quick setup, use my automated script:
   ### ⚠️ Always inspect scripts before running them!
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeltaPhi0/homelab/refs/heads/main/media/samba/samba-setup.sh
   chmod +x samba-setup.sh
   sudo ./samba-setup.sh
   ```
<details>
<summary>See jellyfin-setup.sh</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "What's yout username?"
read USR
sudo apt install samba
sudo mkdir /media/files
sudo chown $USR: /media/files
sudo sh -c 'echo "[files]\n  path = /media/files\n   writeable = yes\n   public = no" >> /etc/samba/smb.conf'
sudo sed -i '/map to guest = bad user/c\    map to guest = never' /etc/samba/smb.conf
echo "enter your new samba username"
sudo smbpasswd -a $USR
sudo systemctl restart smbd
echo -e "You can now access your files throught\nWindows : Map Network Drive, '\ \[your pi's IP]\ files'.\nmacOS : Open Finder >> Connect to Server >> smb://[pi's IP]."
rm samba-setup-sh
```

*Note : this script works only if you have a Debian based OS*
## 🚀 Manual installation

### 1. Install requirements
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install samba
```
### 2. Create shared directory
```bash
sudo mkdir /media/files
sudo chown $USER: /media/files
```
### 3. Configure samba
```bash
nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```
**3.1. Change line**
  - 'map to guest = bad user' → 'map to guest = never'

**3.2. Add at the end of file**
```bash
[files]
  path = /media/files
  writeable = yes
  public = no
```
### 4. Create samba user
```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a $USER
```
**this will create a samba user that matches your machine's username, which is important**
### 5. Apply changes
```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```
