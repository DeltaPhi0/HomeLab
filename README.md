## üåü Why This Matters  
Turn a **‚Ç¨40 Raspberry Pi** into a **secure homelab server** that:  
- Self-hosts services (VPN/media/files) *without cloud fees*  
- has solid security (SSH keys, VPN+local access only)  
- Teaches real sysadmin skills 

## üì¶ Hardware specifications
- **Device**: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (1GB RAM)
- **Storage**: 64GB SD Card
- **Connection**: USB-to-Micro-USB power + Ethernet

## üõ†Ô∏è Initial setup

### 1. OS installation
1. Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Choose **Choose Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) - Debian Bookworm based** version
3. Write to SD card

*Note: Failed Ubuntu Server installation due to HDMI issues led to this choice*

### 2. Network configuration
```bash
# Find your Pi's IP (after first boot)
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

# Test connectivity
ping google.com
```
### 3. Router settings
1. Access router at `192.168.1.1` (may vary)
2. Change subnet to `192.168.0.0/24` or `192.168.222.0/24` (be sure to not choose a conflicting subnet)
3. Set static IP via `nmtui`:
```bash
sudo nmtui
   ```
   - Select "Edit a connection"
   - Configure manual IP (e.g., `192.168.0.100`)

## üîí SSH security setup

### 1. Hostname resolution
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
Add line:  
`192.168.0.100 your-hostname`

### 2. SSH key authentication
**Client machine:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
ssh-copy-id username@hostname
```

**Server security:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Uncomment and modify:  
`PasswordAuthentication no`

## üåê VPN Configuration

### Why Set Up a VPN?

1. **Lock Down Your Network**
   - Adds an extra security layer to keep unwanted visitors out of your homelab
2. **Access Your Lab Securely from Anywhere**
   - Safely connect to your servers, files, or services remotely without exposing them to the open internet
3. **A Practical Tech Flex**
   - It‚Äôs not just for show, self-hosting a VPN demonstrates real world networking and security skills!

### Prerequisites
1. **Static DNS setup** (I used [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/))
2. **Port forwarding #1(OpenVPN)** in router settings:
   - Protocol: UDP
   - WAN Port: 1194
   - LAN Host: [Your Pi's local IP]
   - LAN Port: 1194
3. **Port forwarding #2(WireGuard)** in router settings:
   - Protocol: UDP
   - WAN Port: 51820
   - LAN Host: [Your Pi's local IP]
   - LAN Port: 51820

### WireGuard setup (Mobile access)
```bash
# Install PiVPN
sudo apt install pivpn

# Configure PiVPN (choose WireGuard and DDNS domain)
sudo pivpn add -n wgclient
sudo pivpn -qr
```

1. Scan QR code with WireGuard mobile app
2. Test connection:
   ```bash
   pivpn -c  # Monitor connections
   ```

### OpenVPN setup (Main machine)
**Server:**
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
chmod +x openvpn-install.sh
AUTO_INSTALL=y ./openvpn-install.sh

# Fix TUN if needed:
sudo mkdir -p /dev/net
sudo mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200
sudo chmod 666 /dev/net/tun
```

**Client:**
```bash
scp user@your-pi-ip:client.ovpn ~/
sudo apt install network-manager-openvpn
```
1. Import `client.ovpn` in Network Manager
2. Connect via GUI interface

## üíæ Backup & recovery
1. Before backing up, be sure to shrink partition to minimum possible using either gparted, parted or fdisk
   - e.g. If you have 12.5GB storage, be sure to round it up to the next whole number (in this case, 13GB)
2. Use **Clonezilla** for system backups, very intuitive and user friendly
3. Update fstab after restoration if needed (personally, that has always been my case)
4. Store backups on external drive. ALWAYS remember about the [3-2-1](https://www.veeam.com/blog/321-backup-rule.html) rule. <br>

## üö® Important security notes
- Never share your private SSH key
- Regularly update packages:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```
- Use fail2ban for intrusion prevention
- **Warning:** Only share VPN access with trusted users!!
- (e.g. I personally share it with my brother and a friend of mine, so they can access to my media too.)


## üí° Remember
- `man [command]` is your best friend
- Use `grep` for quick searches:  
  ```bash
  command | grep -i error
  ```
- Always verify commands from untrusted sources
- Keep a setup journal for future reference
